# Investigating Medical Appointment

In this project, we will try to analyse why would some patient not show up for their medical appointment or whether there are reasons for that using 110.527 medical appointments and 14 associated variables.

## File Descriptions
The project includes the following files:

`investigate_medical_appointment.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and results.
`no-showappointment.csv`: This is the dataset used for the analysis.
